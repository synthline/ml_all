## Default of credit card clients using neural network regression with TensorFlow

The following project is my first attempt in implementing neural network regression with TensorFlow.

The dataset is from the **Default of credit card clients from UCI Machine Learning Repository**. 
It can be found on **Kaggle** here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariosfish/default-of-credit-card-clients

Or the **original** one here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients
